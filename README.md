# NBA-Jam-Easier-AI

This small Cheatfile `.CHT` simply turns off the bullshit AI rubberbanding that enables the computer to hit every shot, steal every pass, and smack you around the court when it gets behind by 4 points or more.

Load it through RetroArch's `Cheat` menu and make sure `1D565` (at the bottom) is set to `ON`.

May do one for other emulators as well because it was actually pretty simple -- just change one value in memory from -0xFF to 0x00.

Steal it, take credit for it, change it, improve it, sell it, it's yours.
